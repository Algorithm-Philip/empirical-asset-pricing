## Preparatory Stage

* Here I provide the Python code for Prof. Guofu Zhou's class -- Data Analysis for Investment.

* It is based on Prof. Zhou's MATLAB code.

* The Python distribution I use is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/). 

* The version is Python 3.6. 

* I use Jupyter notebooks to interact with Python. 
* To start it, type *jupyter notebook* in a terminal or "Anaconda command prompt" if you use Windows.
* Comments are welcomed. Contact me via https://www.leifuzhang.net/ or https://github.com/econ2fina.

## FAQs

**1. Why Python, Github and Markdown?**

Because I want to expose you to these powerful tools. Moreover, the homework is relatively (if not very) simple, and Prof. Tran would pay me too much if I just write the solutions via LaTex :)

**2. What are our benefits?**

- They are very useful and you will learn a lot.

- They are popular nowadays. According to my personal experience, Python is more welcome than MATLAB, STATA, SAS and R in industry.

- You can enrich your resumes. Read the following news (Bloomberg, June 14, 2018):

**3. What are our costs?**

If you just want to learn some empirical asset pricing, then no additional effort is needed. If you want to learn more, you only need to study *a little bit* harder...

**4. How do we learn?**

You learn by doing, by playing with my code, by googling and by reading documents.
